This project mainly deals with MD-5 hashing algorithm by using cryptography.

The aim of the work is to encrypt data and verify data using cryptography.This project aims at developing algorithm for encryption.

I have developed 128 bit algorithm and created a application for 512 bit message.

Application of MD5 algorithm is implemented for the stream controlled transfer messages in the network.This would be a high security algorithm for data transferin mobile networking with stream controlled logic.
